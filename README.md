# Colossal Cave Adventure - Inform 7

This code is a project I worked on to create an authentic version of the original colossal cave adventure in the inform 7 languauage. The benefit of this version is that it has the more advanced modern inform 7 parser so can be communicated with more easily and logically. Also, it creates a great example for how to do all sorts of things with inform 7. I tried to use good coding techniques (very few global variables) and make everything very readable (natural language).
