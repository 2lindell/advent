Most of my vocabulary describes places and is used to move you there.  To move, try words like forest, building, downstream, enter, east, west, north, south, up, or down.  I know about a few special objects, like a black rod hidden in the cave.  These objects can be manipulated using some of the action words that I know.  Usually you will need to give both the object and action words (in either order), but sometimes I can infer the object from the verb alone.  Some objects also imply verbs; in particular, 'inventory' implies 'take inventory', which causes me to give you a list of what you're carrying.  The objects have side effects; for instance, the rod scares the bird.  Usually people having trouble moving just need to try a few more words.  Usually people trying unsuccessfully to manipulate an object are attempting something beyond their (or my!) capabilities and should try a completely different tack.  To speed the game you can sometimes move long distances with a single word.  For example, 'building' usually gets you to the building from anywhere above ground except when lost in the forest.  Also, note that cave passages turn a lot, and that leaving a room to the north does not guarantee entering the next from the south.

To suspend your adventure such that you can continue later, say 'suspend' (or 'pause' or 'save').  To see what hours the cave is normally open, say 'hours'.  To see how well you're doing, say 'score'.  To get full credit for a treasure, you must have left it safely in the building, though you get partial credit just for locating it.  You lose points for getting killed, or for quitting, though the former costs you more.  There are also points based on how much (if any) of the cave you've managed to explore; in particular, there is a large bonus just for getting in (to distinguish the beginners from the rest of the pack), and there are other ways to determine whether you've been through some of the more harrowing sections.  If you think you've found all the treasures, just keep exploring for a while.  If nothing interesting happens, you haven't found them all yet.  If something interesting *DOES* happen, it means you're getting a bonus and have an opportunity to garner many more points in the master's section.  I may occasionally offer hints if you seem to be having trouble.  If I do, I'll warn you in advance how much it will effect your score to accept the hints.

The story of the Cave is a curious microcosm of American history. Its discovery is a matter of legend dating back to the 1790s; it is said that a hunter, John Houchin, pursued a wounded bear to a large pit near the Green River and stumbled upon the entrance. The entrance was thick with bats and by the War of 1812 was intensively mined for guano, dissolved into nitrate vats to make saltpetre for gunpowder. After the war prices fell; but the Cave became a minor side-show when a dessicated Indian mummy was found nearby, sitting upright in a stone coffin, surrounded by talismans. In 1815, Fawn Hoof, as she was nicknamed after one of the charms, was taken away by a circus, drawing crowds across America (a tour rather reminiscent of Don McLean's song [</span><span class="substitution">'</span><span class="quote">]The Legend of Andrew McCrew[</span><span class="substitution">'</span><span class="quote">]). She ended up in the Smithsonian but by the 1820s the Cave was being called one of the wonders of the world, largely due to her posthumous efforts.[</span><span class="substitution">paragraph break</span><span class="quote">]</span>&quot;;</p><p class="indent1">say &quot;<span class="quote">By the early nineteenth century European caves were big tourist attractions, but hardly anyone visited the Mammoth, [</span><span class="substitution">'</span><span class="quote">]wonder of the world[</span><span class="substitution">'</span><span class="quote">] or not. Nor was it then especially large (the name was a leftover from the miners, who boasted of their mammoth yields of guano). In 1838, Stephen Bishop's owner bought up the Cave. Stephen, as (being a slave) he was invariably called, was by any standards a remarkable man: self-educated in Latin and Greek, he became famous as the [</span><span class="substitution">'</span><span class="quote">]chief ruler[</span><span class="substitution">'</span><span class="quote">] of his underground realm. He explored and named much of the layout in his spare time, doubling the known map in a year. The distinctive flavour of the Cave's names -- half-homespun American, half-classical -- started with Stephen: the River Styx, the Snowball Room, Little Bat Avenue, the Giant Dome. Stephen found strange blind fish, snakes, silent crickets, the remains of cave bears (savage, playful creatures, five feet long and four high, which became extinct at the end of the last Ice Age), centuries-old Indian gypsum workings and ever more cave. His 1842 map, drafted entirely from memory, was still in use forty years later.[</span><span class="substitution">paragraph break</span><span class="quote">]As a tourist attraction (and, since Stephen's owner was a philanthropist, briefly a sanatorium for tuberculosis, owing to a hopeless medical theory the Cave became big business: for decades nearby caves were hotly seized and legal title endlessly challenged. The neighbouring chain, across Houchins Valley in the Flint Ridge, opened the Great Onyx Cave in 1912. By the 1920s, the Kentucky Cave Wars were in full swing. Rival owners diverted tourists with fake policemen, employed stooges to heckle each other's guided tours, burned down ticket huts, put out libellous and forged advertisements. Cave exploration became so dangerous and secretive that finally in 1941 the U.S. Government stepped in, made much of the area a National Park and effectively banned caving. The gold rush of tourists was, in any case, waning.[</span><span class="substitution">paragraph break</span><span class="quote">]</span>&quot;;</p><p class="indent1">say &quot;<span class="quote">Convinced that the Mammoth and Flint Ridge caves were all linked in a huge chain, explorers tried secret entrances for years, eventually winning official backing. Throughout the 1960s all connections from Flint Ridge -- difficult and water-filled tunnels -- ended frustratingly in chokes of boulders. A [</span><span class="substitution">'</span><span class="quote">]reed-thin[</span><span class="substitution">'</span><span class="quote">] physicist, Patricia Crowther, made the breakthrough in 1972 when she got through the Tight Spot and found a muddy passage: it was a hidden way into the Mammoth Cave.[</span><span class="substitution">paragraph break</span><span class="quote">]Under the terms of his owner's will, Stephen Bishop was freed in 1856, at which time the cave boasted 226 avenues, 47 domes, 23 pits and 8 waterfalls. He died a year later, before he could buy his wife and son. In the 1970s, Crowther's muddy passage was found on his map.[</span><span class="substitution">paragraph break</span><span class="quote">]The Mammoth Cave is huge, its full extent still a matter of speculation (estimates vary from 300 to 500 miles). Although this game has often been called 'Colossal Cave', it is actually a simulation of the Bedquilt Cave region. Here is Will Crowther's story of how it came about:[</span><span class="substitution">paragraph break</span><span class="quote">]</span>&quot;;</p><p class="indent1">say &quot;<span class="quote">'I had been involved in a non-computer role-playing game called Dungeons and Dragons at the time, and also I had been actively exploring in caves -- Mammoth Cave in Kentucky in particular. Suddenly, I got involved in a divorce, and that left me a bit pulled apart in various ways. In particular I was missing my kids. Also the caving had stopped, because that had become awkward, so I decided I would fool around and write a program that was a re-creation in fantasy of my caving, and also would be a game for the kids, and perhaps some aspects of the Dungeons and Dragons that I had been playing.[</span><span class="substitution">paragraph break</span><span class="quote">]'My idea was that it would be a computer game that would not be intimidating to non-computer people, and that was one of the reasons why I made it so that the player directs the game with natural language input, instead of more standardized commands. My kids thought it was a lot of fun.'

The challenge was really to explore, though there was opposition from for instance the snake. Like the real Bedquilt region, Crowther's simulation has a map on about four levels of depth and is rich in geological detail. A good example is the orange column which descends to the Orange River Rock room (where the bird lives): the real column is of orange travertine, a beautiful mineral found in wet limestone.[</span><span class="substitution">paragraph break</span><span class="quote">]The game's language is loaded with references to caving, to [</span><span class="substitution">'</span><span class="quote">]domes[</span><span class="substitution">'</span><span class="quote">] and [</span><span class="substitution">'</span><span class="quote">]crawls[</span><span class="substitution">'</span><span class="quote">].

He tripled the number of treasures and added the non-geological zones: everything from the Troll Bridge onward, together with most of the antechambers on the Bedquilt level. All of the many imitations and extensions of the original Adventure are essentially based on Woods's 350-point edition. (Many bloated, corrupted or enhanced -- it depends how you see it -- versions of the game are in Internet circulation, and the most useful way to identify them is by the maximum attainable score. Many versions exist scoring up to around the 400s and 500s, and one up to 1000. Woods himself continues to release new versions of his game; most of the other extenders haven't his talent.)[</span><span class="substitution">paragraph break</span><span class="quote">]</span>&quot;;</p><p class="indent1">say &quot;<span class="quote">Although the game has veered away from pure simulation, a good deal of it remains realistic. Cavers do turn back when their carbide lamps flicker; there are indeed mysterious markings and initials on the cave walls, some left by the miners, some by Bishop, some by 1920s explorers. Of course there isn't an active volcano in central Kentucky, nor are there dragons and dwarves.

Off to one side a great many dwarves are sleeping on the floor, snoring loudly.  A sign nearby reads: 'Do not disturb the dwarves!'
